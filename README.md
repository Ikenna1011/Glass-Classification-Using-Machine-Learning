# Glass Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying different types of glass based on their physical and chemical attributes. The project involves the following key steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data distribution and relationships.
- **Modeling**: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting

The **Random Forest** model demonstrated the best performance among the tested algorithms, making it the most effective for this classification task.

## Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline.
- Detailed visualizations for data insights.
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models.
- Performance evaluation metrics for model selection.
